This is a demo to test infinite-scaling RPG stats (hp, attack, defence etc.), whilst seeing whether battles can be balanced.

## current todo list

- Proper game intro (more than just asking for player name)
    - Settings menu to change config values from the game

- Overworld system
    - Grid-based map
    - Locked regions, criteria must be met to progress
    - NPCs
    - Buildings & shops

- Battle system rework
    - Allow facing multiple enemies
    - Perhaps allow multiple party members
    - Hit chance
    - Dropped items on defeat
    - Resistance, Immunity, and Weakness attributes
    - Bosses
    - Revamped HUD

- Items
    - Consumables for use in battle
    - Equipable items such as armour or weapons
    - Accessories which provide special functions

More will be added to the list eventually lol

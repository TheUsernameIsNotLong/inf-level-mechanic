This is a demo to test infinite-scaling RPG stats (hp, attack, defence etc.), whilst seeing whether battles can be balanced.

At the moment, you're looped into a repeating battle against an enemy matching your stats, that uses a single attack against you. Once the battle ends you simply repeat the battle. Currently, the enemies found will have their level be up to 40% lower or greater than yours.

I plan to eventually make it more complex, having enemies of different stats found over an overworld system. The enemies encountered will eventaully use a rating system to determine their strength against yours.

## current todo list (in no particular order)

- Proper game intro (more than just asking for player name)
    - Choosing proficiencies (and custom proficiencies!)
    - Classes which have set proficiencies and learnable skills
    - Settings menu to change config values from the game

- More skills
    - HP drain/absorption skill

- More enemies
    - MAYBE (but probably not) incorporate enemies that do not follow the same stat proportions as the player
    - Enemy info & stats viewer (with super cool ASCII art :D)
    - Basic attack deciding system

- Data management (file saving/loading)
  (this has been coded but will likely no longer work by the time i actually come to use it lol)

- Overworld system
    - Grid-based map
    - Locked regions, criteria must be met to progress
    - NPCs
    - Buildings & shops
    - Traps (damage outside of battle)

- Battle system rework
    - Hit chance
    - Dropped items on defeat
    - Resistance, Immunity, and Weakness attributes
    - Bosses
    - Revamped HUD

- Items
    - Consumables for use in battle
    - Equipable items such as armour or weapons
    - Accessories which provide special functions

More will be added to the list eventually lol

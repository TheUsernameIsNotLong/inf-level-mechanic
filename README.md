At the moment, this only has a single enemy type which you fight over and over and gradually become stronger against.


What is planned (mostly in order):

1. Attacks (and a related menu to choose them)
2. Enemy types (standard, tank, light etc.)
3. Status effects (added but not used)
4. Enemy modifiers
5. World map
- A lot more
